description: "Cidre equips his most powerful carbonated rig to battle Luffy, and as they fight Luffy discovers that the Cidre Guild soldiers are local men who Cidre coerced by taking their families hostage. Hancock defeats both Ginger and Guarana, turning them to stone. Luffy is able to defeat Cidre with an Elephant Gun, and Hancock revives the Guild's slaves she had turned to stone. Afterwards, Luffy finds an invitation to the Pirate Fest, and the freed Cidre Guild members gift the Straw Hats several barrels of cola. The Straw Hats sail to Delta Island for the Pirate Fest, with a planned race for Gold Roger's treasure in particular exciting Luffy. Other Supernovas make their way as, elsewhere, Buena Festa looks forward to a clash between Luffy and Douglas Bullet."
