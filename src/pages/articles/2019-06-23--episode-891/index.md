description: "After reading about the Reverie in the newspaper, Luffy's group finds themselves in the perilous sea surrounding Wano Country, which leads to the bottom of a waterfall. Luffy uses the giant carp swimming around them to pull the crew and ship up the waterfall, but they end up sailing into a whirlpool at the top, causing Luffy to be submerged."
