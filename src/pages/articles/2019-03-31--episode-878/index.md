description: "At Foosha Village and an unnamed island in the New World, Makino and Shanks each remember Luffy's experiences with Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates 12 years ago as they read the newspaper story about Luffy's incursion into Totto Land. In the Ryugu Kingdom, Neptune and his family read the news as they prepare to head to the Reverie, and decide to place Fish-Man Island under Luffy's protection. On the Thousand Sunny, Luffy discovers a Raid Suit canister secretly given to him and Sanji by Niji, but Sanji refuses to use it. Carrot then shows the crew the newspaper, where they find out that Luffy and Sanji's bounties have increased and that Luffy is now considered the Fifth Emperor of the Sea."
