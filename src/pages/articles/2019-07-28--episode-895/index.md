description: "The bounty hunter group Cidre Guild unsuccessfully attempt to capture the Straw Hats, leaving the Thousand Sunny without any cola fuel. Luffy visits a nearby island in search of cola and is directed to a factory run by the Cidre Guild but is attacked on the way by Cidre Guild members run by Ginger, leader of the guild's firearms squad. He is knocked into a stream and washes up in a pool where Hancock is bathing. Luffy and members of the Kuja Pirates defeat everyone except Ginger, who escapes using a CO2 attack which separates the Kujas from Luffy and Hancock. As Hancock asks Luffy to attend the Pirates Fest with her, they are attacked by Cidre, the Cidre Guild's commander."
