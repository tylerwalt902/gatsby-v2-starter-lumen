description: "As the royals from Dressrosa and Prodence Kingdom sail to Mariejois for the Reverie, they are attacked by pirates, but are saved by Koby and Helmeppo. Koby becomes flustered when Rebecca shows him the newspaper article about Luffy, and remembers his life-altering encounter with the Straw Hat. The Four Emperors find out that Luffy has also been declared an Emperor, and Shanks reacts positively while the other three react negatively. As the Straw Hats sail to Wano Country, they find out that Luffy's bounty has increased to 1.5 billion berries."
