description: "While the royalty is away for the Reverie, the Peachbeard Pirates raid the Lulucia Kingdom. However, the four commanders of the Revolutionary Army—Morley, Belo Betty, Lindbergh, and Karasu—arrive. Betty uses her ability to encourage the townspeople to fight back, and with the assistance of the other three commanders, they defeat Peachbeard and his crew. Meanwhile, Sabo, Monkey D. Dragon, and Koala reunite with Ivankov and Inazuma on Peachy Island as they wait for the commanders to arrive. Once they arrive, they will discuss their plan to officially declare war on the World Nobles during the Reverie."
